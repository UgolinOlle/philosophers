## üíª„ÉªDescription

Philosophers is a project that introduces the basics of threading a process and how to work with mutexes. It simulates a classic synchronization problem: the dining philosophers problem.

**Features:**
- Simulates philosophers eating, thinking, and sleeping
- Uses threads to represent each philosopher
- Implements mutexes to handle resource sharing (forks)
- Ensures no philosopher starves

**Technologies Used:**
- C Language
- POSIX Threads
- Mutexes
